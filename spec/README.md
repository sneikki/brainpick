# The brainpick spec

This directory is the contract between brainpick implementations. The pip
and npm engines are independent programs; what makes them one product is
that both produce and consume the formats defined here, proven by the shared
fixtures and conformance cases.

## Normative vs advisory

- **Normative** artifacts and behaviors are conformance-tested. Two engines
  compiling the same bundle MUST produce byte-identical normative artifacts
  (after normalizing the volatile fields each spec section names).
- **Advisory** artifacts are schema-described but implementation-defined in
  content (layouts, timelines, caches). Consumers MUST tolerate their
  absence.

## Case classes and partial engines

An engine that does not yet implement a conformance case class MUST skip
those cases VISIBLY (a skip in its test output, never a silent pass) — CI
watches skip counts. A class an engine claims (its tier is implemented) is
never skipped.

## Change process

Spec-first: a behavior change lands as a spec edit plus a new or updated
conformance case/fixture FIRST, then the implementations follow. Golden
files are regenerated only via `scripts/regen-golden.py` (the Python engine
is the reference implementation) and the diffs are reviewed like code.
