# Spec: MCP tools

The MCP spec fixes the six tools both engines expose verbatim, and makes
**small-model ergonomics normative**: at most one required argument
(`brain_write` is the sanctioned two-argument exception), unknown enum values
fall back to defaults with a note, every result carries a `hint`, and every
tool accepts `budget_tokens` (chars/4 estimate; descriptions survive, bodies
trim, truncation is announced).

It specifies each tool's arguments and returns, and the guarded `brain_write`
flow — resolve, compose and stamp, atomic write, henxels referee,
rollback-or-recompile-and-delta — with server-owned clocks (the `timestamp`
and the `add_entry` `**HH:MM**` head never come from the writer), the
frontmatter as `meta` data serialized by the server, plus optimistic
concurrency by `base_sha` with a merge ladder (three-way, then an LLM merge,
else a manual conflict). Two optional resources,
`brain://index` and `brain://doc/{path}`, complement the tools.

Each tool has its own page under the [MCP tool reference](../../reference-mcp.md);
the concept is [MCP tools](../../mcp-tools.md) and the write path is
[guarded writes](../../guarded-writes.md). Back to [Spec reference](../../reference-spec.md).
