# brain_read

`brain_read({doc, sections?, budget_tokens?})` resolves `doc` forgivingly:
exact path → unique file stem → fuzzy title; an ambiguous match returns a
`disambiguation` list instead of content. It returns `frontmatter`, an
`outline`, `content`, and `neighbors` (`in`/`out` as `{path, title}`), with
`truncated` and a `hint`. Over budget it returns the outline plus a leading
excerpt and a hint to request `sections`. Default budget 2000.

The `outline` lists headings and, for a log-shaped doc such as a journal day,
every entry head (`* **HH:MM** …`); a `sections` item that is a time
(`"05:30"`) returns that one entry — the bullet with its continuation lines —
so a day is read one entry at a time.

Behind a federated server ([federation](../../federation.md)) `doc` may be
`alias:path`; an unqualified one is resolved across every brain (one hit
answers, several disambiguate with qualified paths), and the result names its
`brain`.

Its CLI mirror is [brainpick read](../cli/read.md); walk outward from a read
with [brain_neighbors](brain-neighbors.md). Back to [MCP tool reference](../../reference-mcp.md).
