# brainpick search

`brainpick search --situation "…" --terms ID… [--root DIR]` (or the legacy
`brainpick search QUERY`, one string seen by both engines) runs `brain_search` in the terminal,
against the compiled brain, read-only (it never compiles). It returns titles
and descriptions with a match reason — never full bodies.

## Flags

- `--mode MODE` — `auto | keyword | semantic | graph` (default `auto`; an unknown value falls back to `auto`).
- `--limit N` — max hits (default `8`).
- `--json` — print the raw MCP payload as JSON.

Modes and their honest degradation are [search modes](../../search-modes.md);
the tool is [brain_search](../mcp/brain-search.md). If the brain is not compiled
the mirror prints a compile instruction; a stale brain still answers and notes a
recompile is due. Back to [CLI reference](../../reference-cli.md).
