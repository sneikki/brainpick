# Onboarding

`uvx brainpick init` (or `npx brainpick init` — see
[runtime parity](runtime-parity.md)) is designed to feel like magic, which
in practice means: detect, propose, compile, glow — and never interrogate.

The choreography:

1. **Detect the bundle** — an `index.md` with `okf_version`, or a density
   scan for concept documents; link style (markdown vs wikilinks) is sniffed
   into configuration. An empty directory is offered the two starters
   instead — `brainpick init --template brain` for a [brain](brain.md)
   (brainpick's own template, because what it teaches depends on how
   brainpick writes — [The brain template](brain-template.md)), and henxels'
   `okf-llm-wiki` for a plain wiki. "Install brainpick here, I want a brain"
   is a complete instruction to an agent: one command scaffolds the brain,
   installs the henxels referee and compiles it.
2. **Detect the environment** — the [embedding detection](embedding-detection.md)
   ladder, an extraction endpoint for the
   [knowledge graph tier](knowledge-graph-tier.md), and whether a henxels
   contract governs the bundle.
3. **Write the config and compile T1** — sub-second, deterministic, green at
   birth, with a stat line worth reading ("47 concepts · 132 links · 2
   orphans — your brain, compiled").
4. **Hand out the keys** — paste-able MCP snippets for the agents you
   actually run (matching how init itself was invoked), the henxels
   freshness-gate fragment if a contract exists, and an offer to open the
   [holographic brain](holographic-brain.md) with `brainpick serve --open`.

The first wow requires zero API keys: T1 plus the [live deltas](live-deltas.md)
channel already gives you a living graph. Models only make it deeper. And the
wow before the first wow requires zero installs — the hosted
[static snapshot](static-snapshot.md) demo shows a real brain in one click.
