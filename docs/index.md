# The brainpick brain

Brainpick's own documentation, kept as an OKF bundle — the first brain
brainpick ever compiles is this one. Concepts carry `type`, `title`,
`description` and `timestamp` frontmatter; links are relative and their text
is the target's title.

## Concepts

* [The tiers](the-tiers.md) - the four-tier retrieval ladder where every tier is optional except the files
* [Artifact spec](artifact-spec.md) - the runtime-neutral format under `.brainpick/` that both engines must honor
* [Compile pipeline](compile-pipeline.md) - staged, hash-incremental compilation with watch mode and a freshness gate
* [Live deltas](live-deltas.md) - the SSE protocol that keeps every open brain view current without a refresh
* [MCP tools](mcp-tools.md) - the five agent-facing tools and their small-model ergonomics
* [Federation](federation.md) - many brains behind one MCP server: merged search, alias:path addressing, a shared registry
* [Presentations](presentations.md) - agent-driven brain_show: spotlight a subgraph and caption it live in every open UI
* [Search modes](search-modes.md) - keyword, semantic, graph and auto-fusion retrieval with honest degradation
* [Guarded writes](guarded-writes.md) - the henxels-refereed write path for remote agents
* [Authentication](authentication.md) - tokens for agents, a password for humans, and open-by-choice stays first-class
* [The daemon](daemon.md) - brainpickd, the service that owns git sync, supervision, deploy keys and users behind one small control API
* [The desktop app](desktop-app.md) - a Tauri v2 window over the daemon's control API — bootstrap, the add-brain wizard, a tray icon, and no logic of its own
* [Runtime parity](runtime-parity.md) - the capability matrix between the pip and npm engines
* [Knowledge graph tier](knowledge-graph-tier.md) - the algorithmic entity/relation layer derived from links and tags, no model needed
* [Similarity gap-detector](similarity-gap-detector.md) - T2 vectors joined against T1's links to surface semantically-similar, unlinked document pairs
* [Embedding detection](embedding-detection.md) - the backend ladder that makes vectors work without interrogation
* [Holographic brain](holographic-brain.md) - the signature visualization: an anatomical brain you spin, pinch and morph
* [Time machine](time-machine.md) - scrub through the brain's git history and watch it grow, in the cosmos and the hologram alike
* [Static snapshot](static-snapshot.md) - a brain baked into a fully static site — the GitHub Pages demo path, searchable and time-travelling with no engine behind it
* [Shareable views](shareable-views.md) - the address bar as the view: query-param deep links that replicate exactly what the sender sees, with a share button choosing what the link prescribes
* [Onboarding](onboarding.md) - one command from zero to a living brain
* [The hypothesis](the-hypothesis.md) - the bet: a small model with frictionless, evolving knowledge and skills beats a large model without — less VRAM, more current, more intelligence per kWh; and associations are made by the author at write time, the graph derived from them — never extracted retroactively
* [The brain](brain.md) - a wiki meant to be an agent's memory: memory-type folders, a data flow, grounding, an audience and an identity
* [Data flow architecture](data-flow-architecture.md) - episodes distil into knowledge into skills; retrieval runs the mirror path; pointers upward, never copies
* [Grounding](grounding.md) - every claim says where it came from, inline and Wikipedia-style, no citation template
* [Brain subsidiarity](brain-subsidiarity.md) - the closest brain wins, brains are addressed by id not location, duplicate or point
* [The brain template](brain-template.md) - the henxels starter template that scaffolds a brainpick-compatible _brain/, what is fixed for life and what is cheap to change
* [Structure agnosticism](structure-agnosticism.md) - principle 14: brainpick reads root, frontmatter and reserved names, never folder layout — any layout compiles, old brains keep working
* [The two-axis ontology](ontology.md) - why every page carries type (document form) and about (ontological subject) as two independent, henxels-enforced fields
* [Agent integrations](agent-integrations.md) - a shipped skill, one-command integrations, and a brain report that teaches graph-before-grep
* [Wiki conventions](wiki-conventions.md) - how concepts in this wiki are written and linked
* [Reference](reference.md) - the source-derivable reference hub: CLI, config, spec, MCP tools and henxels rules, one page each
* [CLI reference](reference-cli.md) - every brainpick subcommand and its flags
* [Configuration reference](reference-config.md) - every brainpick.toml key with its default and allowed values
* [Spec reference](reference-spec.md) - the normative spec documents both engines honor, summarized
* [MCP tool reference](reference-mcp.md) - the six agent-facing tools, one page each
* [Henxels contract reference](reference-henxels.md) - each rule and behaviour in henxels.yaml
* [Architecture decision records](reference-adr.md) - the founding and major decisions, one interlinked ADR per page with context and consequences

## concepts

- [Agent integrations](agent-integrations.md) — How brainpick meets agents where they live — a shipped Agent Skill, one-command integrations for each harness, four CLI query mirrors, and an AGENTS.md brain report that teaches graph-before-grep.
- [Architecture decision records](reference-adr.md) — The founding and major decisions behind brainpick — one Architecture Decision Record per call, each with its context, alternatives and consequences, richly cross-linked.
- [Artifact spec](artifact-spec.md) — Everything under .brainpick/ is a documented, runtime-neutral format — the contract that lets the pip and npm engines read the same compiled brain.
- [Authentication](authentication.md) — Tokens for agents, a password for humans, and open-by-choice as a first-class setup — how a brain locks its door without ever committing a secret.
- [Brain subsidiarity](brain-subsidiarity.md) — When several brains hold conflicting information the one closest to the implementation wins; how brains address each other by identity rather than location, why the human-readable slug rides next to the id in every cross-brain link, and the procedure for deciding whether shared knowledge stays duplicated or becomes a pointer.
- [CLI reference](reference-cli.md) — Every brainpick subcommand and its flags, derived from the argparse CLI — compile and serve, the read mirrors, writes, presentations, onboarding and auth.
- [Compile pipeline](compile-pipeline.md) — How brainpick compiles a bundle — staged, hash-incremental, cron-able and watchable, with a fast freshness check for commit gates.
- [Configuration reference](reference-config.md) — Every brainpick.toml key with its default, type and allowed values, derived from config.py and the config spec — plus layering, env overrides and the auth file.
- [Data flow architecture](data-flow-architecture.md) — How information moves through a brain — episodes in the journal distil into evergreen knowledge and then into actionable skills, retrieval runs the mirror path from most distilled to least, and each layer points upward instead of repeating — the principle that makes a brain memory rather than a pile of pages.
- [Embedding detection](embedding-detection.md) — The ladder brainpick climbs to find an embedding backend — explicit config, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, an in-process local ONNX model in either engine, or an honest off.
- [Federation](federation.md) — Many brains behind one MCP server — an agent asks once and every registered brain answers, hits merged and paths qualified as alias:path, so a project's knowledge and your personal brain are one search away.
- [Grounding](grounding.md) — Every claim in a brain's knowledge and skills says where it came from — inline, Wikipedia-style, with a plain link to a journal entry, an external page, another brain, or an admitted assumption — so the kind of source is readable at the claim and provenance never needs a citation template or a frontmatter key.
- [Guarded writes](guarded-writes.md) — brain_write lets agents add knowledge through MCP, but nothing touches the brain without passing the henxels contract first.
- [Henxels contract reference](reference-henxels.md) — Each rule and behaviour in henxels.yaml — the structural contract that governs this repo — with what it checks and how to satisfy or consciously override it.
- [Holographic brain](holographic-brain.md) — The signature visualization — the knowledge graph arranged into an anatomical brain you spin and pinch, morphing to a flat GPU cosmos for analysis.
- [Knowledge graph tier](knowledge-graph-tier.md) — T3 derives an entity/relation layer algorithmically — ghosts and tags, no model needed — the only backend this tier ships; LLM extraction was tried and dropped in favor of the similarity gap-detector.
- [Live deltas](live-deltas.md) — The SSE protocol that streams graph changes to every open UI — the brain updates in real time, never by page refresh.
- [MCP tool reference](reference-mcp.md) — The six MCP tools brainpick exposes — overview, search, read, neighbors, write, show — one page each, with their arguments, returns and small-model ergonomics.
- [MCP tools](mcp-tools.md) — The six MCP tools brainpick exposes — overview, search, read, neighbors, write, show — designed so a 27B model guesses right on the first try.
- [Onboarding](onboarding.md) — One command from zero to a living brain — init detects the bundle and the models, compiles instantly, and hands every agent its config snippet.
- [Presentations](presentations.md) — brain_show lets an agent spotlight a subgraph, fly the camera and caption it — pushed live to every open UI, so the agent side can reach across to the human side and say "let me show you".
- [Reference](reference.md) — The source-derivable reference for brainpick — every CLI command, config key, spec contract, MCP tool and henxels rule, one page each, richly cross-linked, plus the decision volume.
- [Runtime parity](runtime-parity.md) — What the pip and npm packages each do natively — the capability matrix that keeps "one spec, two engines" honest, and how the claims are proven.
- [Search modes](search-modes.md) — One search tool, four strategies — keyword, semantic, graph, and auto-fusion — with honest reporting when a tier is unavailable.
- [Shareable views](shareable-views.md) — The address bar is the view — doc, cosmos/brain, layer, lens and time moment as query params, so a copy-pasted URL replicates what the sender sees; the share button chooses which dimensions the link prescribes.
- [Similarity gap-detector](similarity-gap-detector.md) — T2 vectors joined against T1's link graph to surface semantically-similar, unlinked document pairs — a second signal alongside the algorithmic knowledge graph, cheap and cumulative where LLM extraction was neither.
- [Spec reference](reference-spec.md) — The normative spec documents both engines honor — manifest, the three tiers, REST, live deltas, MCP, config, timeline and presentations — each summarized here.
- [Static snapshot](static-snapshot.md) — A brain baked into a fully static site — the engine's own API responses as files plus a UI build that searches, walks and time-travels client-side; the GitHub Pages demo path.
- [Structure agnosticism](structure-agnosticism.md) — Principle 14 — brainpick is a thin view, not a format owner: it reads the bundle root, frontmatter and OKF's reserved names, never folder layout, so a wiki, a brain or anything in between compiles the same way and a brain born on any template version keeps working with every later brainpick.
- [The brain](brain.md) — A brain is a wiki meant to be an agent's memory — an OKF bundle with memory-type folders, a declared data flow architecture, inline grounding, an audience and an identity other brains can address; what makes it more than a wiki, and what brainpick does with the difference.
- [The brain template](brain-template.md) — The henxels starter template that scaffolds a brainpick-compatible _brain/ — the rules it enforces, how they split between henxels (structure) and brainpick (serving), what is fixed for life versus cheap to iterate, how the docs get read at all, and the migration story for later format versions.
- [The daemon](daemon.md) — brainpickd — the service that owns every brain's git sync, supervision, deploy keys, LAN reachability and users behind one small control API; every face (desktop app, browser, CLI) is a thin client of it.
- [The desktop app](desktop-app.md) — A Tauri v2 window over the daemon's control API — first-run bootstrap, an add-brain wizard, and a tray icon; no business logic lives in the app, only in brainpickd.
- [The hypothesis](the-hypothesis.md) — The bet brainpick is built on — a small model with frictionless access to knowledge and skills that evolve in real time becomes a self-improving agent that outperforms a large model without such access, at a fraction of the VRAM, compute and energy; the sub-hypothesis that associations are made by the author at write time under the contract and the graph derived from them, not extracted retroactively by a model as LightRAG does; why the brain format is what makes outside memory trustworthy, and how the bet gets tested.
- [The tiers](the-tiers.md) — Brainpick's four-tier retrieval ladder, where every tier is optional except the files and each degrades gracefully to the one below.
- [The two-axis ontology](ontology.md) — Why every page carries two independent fields — type (its document form) and about (its subject's ontological category) — and the philosophy lineage behind the split.
- [Time machine](time-machine.md) — The history dimension — brainpick distills the bundle's git history into a timeline artifact so you can scrub the whole brain's past, and every doc carries a version rail through its own commits.
- [Wiki conventions](wiki-conventions.md) — How concepts in this wiki are written, typed and linked — including the practical, day-to-day guide to classifying type and about — and why this wiki doubles as brainpick's dogfood corpus.

## reference/adr

- [ADR: LanceDB as the vector store](reference/adr/lancedb-vector-store.md) — Why brainpick stores T2 vectors in LanceDB over sqlite-vec — one on-disk format both runtimes read — while BM25 keyword search deliberately stays out of it.
- [ADR: PyPI first, npm parked](reference/adr/pypi-first-release.md) — Why v0.1 publishes to PyPI only — the Node engine stays a native peer in the repo, but the npm registry release waits until there is demand to serve.
- [ADR: TDD and the pre-push regression armor](reference/adr/tdd-regression-armor.md) — Why TDD is mandatory, every verification test joins the permanent suite, and the pre-push gate runs both engines plus e2e — tests define the feature set that must always work.
- [ADR: agent-agnostic, AGENTS.md is the one agent doc](reference/adr/agent-agnostic.md) — Why brainpick plays no favorites among harnesses — MCP, CLI and plain files serve any agent — and keeps one agent-facing document, AGENTS.md, with CLAUDE.md as a thin wrapper.
- [ADR: brain_show, agent-driven presentations](reference/adr/brain-show-presentations.md) — Why an agent can spotlight and caption a subgraph live in every UI through an ephemeral, advisory brain_show that rides the delta channel and is not gated behind writes.
- [ADR: dogfood henxels and codumentation from day one](reference/adr/dogfood-henxels-codumentation.md) — Why brainpick governs its own repo with henxels and validates its own docs with codumentation from the first commit, and keeps its wiki as the live dogfood corpus.
- [ADR: guarded writes from day one](reference/adr/guarded-writes-day-one.md) — Why brainpick lets remote agents write to the brain from the first release, with henxels refereeing every write, rather than shipping a read-only MCP surface.
- [ADR: layered configuration, shared over local over env](reference/adr/config-layering.md) — Why configuration splits into a shared brainpick.toml and a gitignored brainpick.local.toml, layered under environment and flags, so personal endpoints never collide with shared policy.
- [ADR: one spec, two native engines](reference/adr/one-spec-two-engines.md) — Why brainpick ships native Python and Node engines that never require each other, kept honest by a shared conformance harness instead of a single implementation with a thin client.
- [ADR: optimistic concurrency and the merge ladder](reference/adr/optimistic-concurrency-merge-ladder.md) — Why concurrent writes resolve through a base_sha check and a three-way then LLM merge ladder whose proposals are never auto-applied, rather than last-write-wins or locks.
- [ADR: perfect UX and AX are fruits of great DX](reference/adr/dx-first.md) — Why brainpick invests first in developer experience — the artifact spec, TDD, conformance, the henxels contract and codumented docs — as the mechanism that keeps the agent and human surfaces perfect.
- [ADR: ship the full stack in one v0.1 release](reference/adr/full-stack-v0-1.md) — Why brainpick builds T1 through T3, MCP, CLI and the live UI as one v0.1 release before any publish, rather than shipping a thin slice first.
- [ADR: small models are first-class citizens](reference/adr/small-models-first-class.md) — Why every tool, schema and budget targets a local 27B-class model first, treating frontier models as a speed bonus rather than the design center.
- [ADR: the KGBackend adapter](reference/adr/kgbackend-adapter.md) — Why T3 entity derivation runs through a narrow KGBackend seam and a neutral JSONL export even with one shipped backend — a test/mock hook, not a hedge for LightRAG, which this contract has since dropped.
- [ADR: the Time Machine distills git history](reference/adr/time-machine-timeline.md) — Why time travel reads a single advisory timeline.json distilled from one git log, reconstructing any moment by filtering, rather than recompiling the brain at every commit.
- [ADR: the WYSIWYG editor on ProseMirror](reference/adr/wysiwyg-prosemirror-editor.md) — Why the in-browser editor is built on ProseMirror with a byte-faithful markdown round-trip and lazy-loaded off the main bundle, writing through the same guarded path as brain_write.
- [ADR: the brain format is a spec, the brain template lives in henxels](reference/adr/brain-template-in-henxels.md) — Why brainpick specifies what a brain is but does not scaffold one — the starter template ships as a henxels use-case template, brainpick stays a renderer of well-formed data, and the two meet through the [brain] config section and a wiki the template links back to.
- [ADR: the files are the brain and compiled state is disposable](reference/adr/files-are-the-brain.md) — Why markdown plus frontmatter is the only source of truth and everything under .brainpick is disposable — the guarantee that deleting it loses nothing.
- [ADR: the holographic brain and cosmos UI](reference/adr/holographic-brain-ui.md) — Why the human face is a procedural holographic brain that morphs to a flat GPU cosmos, touch-first and installable, rendering the exact graph agents query rather than decorative data.
- [ADR: the similarity gap-detector](reference/adr/similarity-gap-detector.md) — Why a vector-vs-graph cross-check replaces LLM extraction as T3's second signal — cumulative and free, where extraction re-derived the whole graph from zero every pass.
- [ADR: the two-axis ontology](reference/adr/two-axis-ontology.md) — Why every page carries two independent fields — type (document form) and about (ontological subject) — instead of one conflated vocabulary, and why process replaces a hardcoded project type.
- [ADR: tokens for agents, a password for humans, open by default](reference/adr/auth-model.md) — Why a brain is open by default and adds two credentials only when it leaves the laptop — bearer tokens for agents, a session password for humans — with scrypt hashes that outlive the compiled artifacts.
- [ADR: whole-graph deltas over SSE](reference/adr/whole-graph-deltas-sse.md) — Why the brain updates live by diffing whole-graph snapshots over Server-Sent Events, so correctness never depends on incremental edit-log bookkeeping and any compile source yields exact deltas.

## reference/cli

- [brainpick compile](reference/cli/compile.md) — Compile the bundle into .brainpick/ artifacts — with --full, --check-fresh, --only, --sample and --watch.
- [brainpick doctor](reference/cli/doctor.md) — Diagnose config, bundle, artifacts, backends and UI — the fix-it command when a brain misbehaves.
- [brainpick init](reference/cli/init.md) — Detect the bundle and backends, write config, and compile T1 — the one command from zero to a living brain.
- [brainpick integrate](reference/cli/integrate.md) — Install brainpick into an agent harness — the skill, an MCP snippet and the brain report — additively, with --dry-run.
- [brainpick mcp](reference/cli/mcp.md) — Speak MCP over stdio for agent hosts — the transport the init snippets configure.
- [brainpick neighbors](reference/cli/neighbors.md) — Walk the link graph around a doc — the brain_neighbors tool as a CLI verb, with --depth and --layer.
- [brainpick overview](reference/cli/overview.md) — One screen of the whole brain — counts, tier status and every doc — the brain_overview tool as a CLI verb.
- [brainpick password](reference/cli/password.md) — Manage the web UI password — set it (TTY prompt or --stdin) or clear it to reopen the UI without a login.
- [brainpick read](reference/cli/read.md) — Read one doc from the brain by path, stem or approximate title — the brain_read tool as a CLI verb.
- [brainpick recall](reference/cli/recall.md) — The prompt hook: a harness pipes its hook payload in, recall searches the brain with the prompt and prints the matching memories as hook context, each once per session.
- [brainpick register](reference/cli/register.md) — Add a brain to the federation registry — or list it, or remove one — so a single brainpick mcp entry fronts every brain you work with.
- [brainpick search](reference/cli/search.md) — Search the compiled brain from the terminal — the brain_search tool as a CLI verb: --situation and --terms (or a single legacy query), --mode, --limit and --json.
- [brainpick serve](reference/cli/serve.md) — Serve REST, live deltas, the web UI and MCP from one process — with --host, --port, --no-watch and --open.
- [brainpick show](reference/cli/show.md) — Present a subgraph live in every open UI — posts to a running server, with --focus, --mode, --annotate and --clear.
- [brainpick token](reference/cli/token.md) — Manage bearer tokens for agents — create (prints the secret once), list (never secrets) and revoke.

## reference/config

- [Config layering and precedence](reference/config/layering.md) — How brainpick.toml, brainpick.local.toml, environment variables and CLI flags stack — shared policy under machine-local endpoints under env under flags.
- [Environment overrides](reference/config/env-overrides.md) — Override any config key from the environment — BRAINPICK_<SECTION>_<KEY>, and BRAINPICK_MODELS_<TABLE>_<KEY> for model tables.
- [The auth file](reference/config/auth-file.md) — Where credentials live — .brainpick-auth.json at the bundle root, salted scrypt hashes only, gitignored, surviving rm -rf .brainpick/.
- [brain.audience](reference/config/brain-audience.md) — Who a brain is written for — personal, team or public — which decides what gets documented and how much context a page may assume; unknown values warn and fall back to personal.
- [brain.format](reference/config/brain-format.md) — The brain-format version a bundle follows — 0 (absent) means a plain wiki, 1 means the brain format of spec/85; the stamp a future `brainpick migrate` bumps.
- [brain.origin](reference/config/brain-origin.md) — The canonical git URL of a brain — how other people find and clone it; a lookup key for the federation registry, never the brain's identity, which is bundle.id.
- [brain.readers](reference/config/brain-readers.md) — For a team brain, the people or roles it assumes as readers — by handle or role name — so a writing agent knows whose context it may take for granted.
- [bundle.exclude](reference/config/bundle-exclude.md) — Extra globs to drop from the scan — default [] — on top of the four directory names always excluded at any depth.
- [bundle.id](reference/config/bundle-id.md) — A random opaque identifier minted by brainpick init and committed with the bundle — an address for this brain, never a credential — default "" (absent).
- [bundle.include](reference/config/bundle-include.md) — The glob list of files scanned as bundle documents — default ["**/*.md"].
- [bundle.root](reference/config/bundle-root.md) — Where the OKF bundle lives relative to the config file — default "." — so the config can sit at a repo root pointing at a subdirectory bundle.
- [index.file](reference/config/index-file.md) — The filename brainpick generates the index into — default "index.md".
- [index.mode](reference/config/index-mode.md) — How brainpick manages the generated index.md — section (default), manage or off.
- [models.embedding](reference/config/models-embedding.md) — The T2 embedding backend — kind, endpoint, model, dim and the optional task prefixes — a machine-local table that belongs in brainpick.local.toml.
- [models.extraction](reference/config/models-extraction.md) — The chat model behind the brain_write merge resolver — its one real production purpose since T3's LLM extraction was removed; kind, endpoint, model and api_key_env.
- [modules.graph](reference/config/modules-graph.md) — The T3 switch — on (default, algorithmic derivation), auto, or off.
- [modules.similarity_gaps](reference/config/modules-similarity-gaps.md) — The gap-detector switch — auto (default, on iff T2 is fresh), on or off.
- [modules.ui](reference/config/modules-ui.md) — Whether the web UI is served — a boolean, default true.
- [modules.vectors](reference/config/modules-vectors.md) — The T2 semantic-vectors switch — auto (default), on or off.
- [serve.host](reference/config/serve-host.md) — The bind host for brainpick serve — default 127.0.0.1; a non-localhost bind requires a token.
- [serve.max_asset_bytes](reference/config/serve-max-asset-bytes.md) — The upload size cap for POST /api/assets — default 8388608 bytes (8 MiB).
- [serve.port](reference/config/serve-port.md) — The bind port for brainpick serve — default 4747.
- [serve.token](reference/config/serve-token.md) — A bootstrap bearer token required for non-localhost binds — default empty, superseded by real tokens once any exist.
- [serve.transports](reference/config/serve-transports.md) — Which MCP transports the server mounts — default ["streamable-http"], with "sse" for the legacy transport.
- [serve.watch](reference/config/serve-watch.md) — Whether the server watches the bundle and recompiles on change — a boolean, default true.
- [serve.writes](reference/config/serve-writes.md) — Whether writes are exposed and how — guarded (default) or off.
- [similarity_gaps.max_pairs](reference/config/similarity-gaps-max-pairs.md) — Cap on reported pairs, highest score first — default 50.
- [similarity_gaps.threshold](reference/config/similarity-gaps-threshold.md) — Minimum cosine similarity to report a pair — default 0.75.
- [spec (config version)](reference/config/spec-version.md) — The top-level spec key that names the config/spec version a bundle targets — default 0.1.
- [ui.default_mode](reference/config/ui-default-mode.md) — The view the web UI opens in — cosmos (default) or brain.
- [ui.max_nodes_mobile](reference/config/ui-max-nodes-mobile.md) — The node cap the web UI applies on mobile or weak GPUs — default 8000 — shipped to the client so it stops guessing from the GPU tier.
- [validate.henxels](reference/config/validate-henxels.md) — When the compile pipeline runs the henxels contract — auto (default), always or never.

## reference/henxels

- [Behaviour: deletes are blocked until blessed](reference/henxels/delete-guard.md) — The confirm_before_deleting behaviour — losing files or many lines must be deliberate, blocked until henxels bless delete.
- [Behaviour: push is blocked until blessed](reference/henxels/push-guard.md) — The confirm_before_push behaviour — pushing is Tom's call, blocked until henxels bless push.
- [Behaviour: the near-copy warning](reference/henxels/similar-files.md) — The warn_about_similar_files behaviour — a nudge when a new file looks like a near-copy of a committed one, above a similarity threshold.
- [Henxel: a concept is a node, not an orphan](reference/henxels/no-orphans.md) — The henxel requiring every concept doc to link out at least once — a concept is a node in the knowledge graph, never an island.
- [Henxel: a doc's subject is classified (about)](reference/henxels/about-classification.md) — The henxel constraining every docs/ page's about field to the seven-value ontological-subject enum — the territory axis, orthogonal to type's form axis.
- [Henxel: concept docs carry OKF frontmatter](reference/henxels/concept-frontmatter.md) — The henxel requiring every docs/ concept to be kebab-case markdown with type/about/title/description frontmatter, type from the five-value form enum.
- [Henxel: documented claims stay true](reference/henxels/docs-truth.md) — The pre-push henxel that runs codumentation validate, so documented claims are executable specifications rather than drift.
- [Henxel: every link lands](reference/henxels/links-land.md) — The henxel that every relative and root-absolute internal link resolves to a real file — a warn-level nudge, not a block, so a ghost link can stand as a promise to write later.
- [Henxel: reserved files stay frontmatter-free](reference/henxels/reserved-frontmatter-free.md) — The henxel that OKF reserved files — index.md and log.md — carry no frontmatter, except the bundle root index which may declare okf_version.
- [Henxel: the Python engine's tests pass](reference/henxels/tests-pass.md) — The pre-commit henxel that runs the Python engine's pytest suite, because tests define the feature set.
- [Henxel: the bundle root has an index](reference/henxels/root-index.md) — The henxel that docs/ has an index.md and every top-level concept is referenced in it — maintained by hand until brainpick generates it.
- [Henxel: the scratch folder survives](reference/henxels/scratch-folder.md) — The henxel requiring _temp/ and its .gitkeep to exist, so scratch and pipeline intermediates never litter the repo root.
- [Henxel: the whole feature set works](reference/henxels/whole-feature-set.md) — The pre-push henxel that runs the Node, webui and e2e suites — the full regression armor before anything reaches the remote.
- [Henxel: timestamp is bumped on change](reference/henxels/timestamp-bump.md) — The henxel requiring a real ISO 8601 datetime timestamp that is bumped whenever a doc changes.
- [Henxel: update logs are date-sectioned](reference/henxels/log-sections.md) — The custom henxel that a log.md is organized into date headings, newest first.

## reference/mcp

- [brain_neighbors](reference/mcp/brain-neighbors.md) — Adjacency around a doc — depth 1–3, on the link layer, the entity layer, or both — with entities degrading to links until T3.
- [brain_overview](reference/mcp/brain-overview.md) — The orientation tool — bundle name, counts, tier availability and the index tree — the progressive-disclosure root, with no required arguments.
- [brain_read](reference/mcp/brain-read.md) — Read one doc with forgiving resolution (path, stem, fuzzy title), returning frontmatter, outline, content and neighbors, shaped to a token budget.
- [brain_search](reference/mcp/brain-search.md) — Two-input search — terms for the keyword engine, situation for the semantic one, fused — returning titles, descriptions and the matched snippet, never full bodies.
- [brain_show](reference/mcp/brain-show.md) — Spotlight a subgraph live in every open UI — every argument optional, ephemeral and advisory, gated by auth only, not by writes.
- [brain_write](reference/mcp/brain-write.md) — The one guarded write path — resolve, atomic write, henxels referee, rollback or recompile — with base_sha optimistic concurrency and a merge ladder.

## reference/spec

- [Spec: MCP tools](reference/spec/mcp-tools.md) — The normative contract for the six tools — small-model ergonomics, budget_tokens, the guarded brain_write flow with optimistic concurrency, and resources.
- [Spec: REST API](reference/spec/rest-api.md) — The HTTP surface both servers implement — health, status, graph, docs (live and at any commit), search, neighbors, live, timeline, show, guarded writes and asset upload.
- [Spec: T1 artifacts](reference/spec/t1-artifacts.md) — The deterministic heart — document scanning, link extraction, graph.json (nodes, edges, ghosts, islands, orphans, tags), docs.jsonl, and the generated index.
- [Spec: T2 vectors](reference/spec/t2-vectors.md) — Semantic recall — the normative char-based chunker, chunks.jsonl, the embedding record, the LanceDB layout, the detection ladder and RRF fusion.
- [Spec: T3 knowledge graph](reference/spec/t3-kg.md) — A second, derived view — the neutral export (entities, relations, kg-meta) is normative for the algorithmic backend, the only one this contract ships, with normative query semantics.
- [Spec: brain format](reference/spec/brain-format.md) — The normative contract for a brain — the fixed _brain/ root, the five memory-type folders, the engine-consumed frontmatter keys and their additive-only policy, inline grounding, the data flow's folder order, the [brain] config section, the brain:// link syntax and the format version with its migration rule.
- [Spec: configuration](reference/spec/config.md) — The configuration contract — one TOML file, shared vs machine-local layering, precedence, the auth storage design and the model sections.
- [Spec: federation](reference/spec/federation.md) — The normative contract for many brains behind one MCP server — brain set assembly, the registry, aliases and alias:path, scope, merged search, routed reads and the never-guessing write.
- [Spec: live deltas](reference/spec/live-deltas.md) — The SSE protocol — hello, graph.delta, graph.snapshot, compile.status and brain.show — reconstructible from the stream alone, with a replay ring buffer.
- [Spec: manifest](reference/spec/manifest.md) — The root of trust — manifest.json — plus canonical serialization, the monotonic seq counter, tier status and the freshness check.
- [Spec: overview](reference/spec/overview.md) — The spec's map of the whole system — the three tiers, what each needs, T1's mandatory determinism, and the disposability guarantee.
- [Spec: presentations](reference/spec/presentations.md) — Agent-driven views — the normative brain_show payload (nodes, focus, mode, annotation, seq), its ephemeral advisory nature, the live event and UI behaviour.
- [Spec: recall](reference/spec/recall.md) — The normative contract for brainpick recall — the hook payload, the six-word gate, the prompt as situation and its identifiers as terms, once-per-session keys, and the exact rendered hook context.
- [Spec: similarity gaps](reference/spec/similarity-gaps.md) — T2 vectors joined against T1's link graph to surface semantically-similar, unlinked document pairs — advisory in content, normative in layout, with a dismiss/allowlist mechanism.
- [Spec: timeline](reference/spec/timeline.md) — The history dimension — timeline.json distilled from one git log, advisory in content but normative in layout, with normative reconstruction semantics.
