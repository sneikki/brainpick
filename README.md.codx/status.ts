**Early, and a fork.** The full stack is built; upstream's desktop app is
downloadable from its [Releases](https://github.com/benquemax/brainpick/releases)
for early testers. The vision is committed in
[\`_vision.md\`](https://github.com/sneikki/brainpick/blob/main/_vision.md);
the milestones (Ensilento → Kaksoisveto → Hologrammi) landed. Upstream's
\`brainpick\` pip package is [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/brainpick/)
as of v0.1; this fork publishes nothing yet and installs from git. The npm
publish is
[parked by ADR](https://github.com/sneikki/brainpick/blob/main/docs/reference/adr/pypi-first-release.md);
the Node engine ships in-repo as a native peer until npm-side demand shows up.

[Validation Failed] The "Status" section drifted from reality.

_vision.md must exist (it is the committed north star), and the milestones
named here (Ensilento, Kaksoisveto, Hologrammi) must match the parking lot in
_todo.md. Update whichever side actually changed.
