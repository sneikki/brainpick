export const content = `## The hypothesis

A small model with **frictionless access to knowledge and skills that
evolve in real time** becomes a self-improving agent — and not merely as
capable as an agent on a large frontier model, but *more* capable than one
whose large model lacks that access. The large model's knowledge is frozen
at training time; the brain's is corrected the moment an agent notices it
was wrong.

Brainpick is built on that bet. Its target architecture puts *just enough*
intelligence inside the model — reading, reasoning, tool use — and keeps
knowledge and skills **outside** it, in a brain that any agent can read,
ground, and improve as it works:

- **Less VRAM and compute.** Skills and facts are not baked into weights, so
  the model that runs them can be a 27B on your own machine (principle 1),
  not a data-center model. Learning something new is a commit, not a
  fine-tune.
- **A better, more current world model.** A brain is corrected in real
  time by every agent that uses it, grounded to its sources, and refereed
  on every write — where a large model's understanding is as old as its
  training cut-off and as opaque as its weights.
- **More intelligence per kWh.** The same task done by a small model over a
  living brain costs a fraction of the energy of a frontier model rediscovering
  the answer from scratch — and the second time, the answer is a skill.

**A sub-hypothesis: associations are made at write time, by the author,
not extracted afterwards.** When an agent writes to a brain it already has
the relevant pages in its context — it just read them to ground what it is
saying — so the associations come **for free**: it links them, tags them,
and henxels refuses the write if it did not. The knowledge graph is then
*derived* from what the files carry — T1 from the links, T3 from tags and
ghosts — algorithmically, in under a second, on every commit; vectors (T2)
supply the semantic connections nobody wrote, and the similarity gap-detector
joins the two to flag what *should* be linked. Compare the widely used
LLM-extracted graphs (LightRAG, GraphRAG): a model reads the corpus
*retroactively*, without the author's context, to guess at associations the
author already had — expensive enough to run once in a while, outdated from
day one, and re-derived from zero every pass, so nothing an agent learns
today makes tomorrow's graph better. Brainpick ran LightRAG early on and
retired it for exactly that reason
([ADR](https://github.com/sneikki/brainpick/blob/main/docs/reference/adr/similarity-gap-detector.md));
there is no LLM extractor in the mix. A graph the brain's own authors build
as they write is one the brain evolves *with*; a graph extracted from it is
a snapshot of it. Yes, this is reinventing knowledge graphs — on the premise
that the associations belong in the files, where they are made by whoever
knows them best, at the moment they are known.

Everything else in this README is engineering in service of that bet: the
[brain format](https://github.com/sneikki/brainpick/blob/main/spec/85-brain-format.md)
turns notes into memory with a data flow (journals → knowledge → skills),
[henxels](https://github.com/benquemax/henxels) keeps every write true so the
brain can be trusted, and the tiers make retrieval cheap enough that a small
model never has to *remember* — only to *look*. The hypothesis is testable and
we intend to test it: the same tasks, a small model with a brain against a
large one without, measured in outcomes and in watt-hours.

The bet on small models must be stated in _vision.md (## The hypothesis) and

point at a spec/85 that has a data flow architecture, and cite an ADR that
