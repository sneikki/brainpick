whole point is that you can stop at any layer and nothing above is owed.

- **henxels** is the foundation: a
  [contract](https://github.com/benquemax/henxels) that makes the layers above
  it *hold* under agent writes — from a git hook or from \`brain_write\` alike.
  Brainpick itself never requires it (a hand-tended OKF folder compiles fine);
  without it the format is a hope, with it the format is a fact. It also ships
  the \`okf-llm-wiki\` template for a wiki; the brain template is brainpick's
  own (\`brainpick init --template brain\`), because it teaches how brainpick
  writes.
- **OKF** is the file format: plain markdown, a frontmatter \`type\`, an
  \`index.md\`, a \`log.md\`. Any OKF bundle — a wiki, a docs folder, a pile of
  notes with \`type:\` — is a valid input to everything above.
- **The brain format** ([spec/85](https://github.com/sneikki/brainpick/blob/main/spec/85-brain-format.md))
  is OKF plus opinions: folders as memory types (\`knowledge/ skills/
  journals/ vision/ plans/\`, \`raw/\` for source material), inline grounding,
  a data-flow architecture (journals → knowledge → skills, read in reverse),
  subsidiarity between brains, and an identity other brains can address.
  Brainpick reads it through frontmatter only — the folders are the
  template's, so the format can evolve without breaking older brains.
- **Brainpick for agents** compiles any bundle into the tiers below and
  serves them over MCP and the CLI. Deterministic tiers need nothing;
  vectors need an embedding model; every tier degrades to the one beneath.
- **Brainpick for humans** renders the same compiled graph as a live
  holographic brain — a window, never a dependency.

Read it bottom-up as adoption: govern a folder → make it OKF → shape it as a
brain → give it to your agent → look at it. Read it top-down as
dependency: nothing above depends on anything more than the layer below.
